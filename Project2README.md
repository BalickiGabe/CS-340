To me, it is important to write programs that are testable, readable, and understandable. The advantages to working in this way are that it is is easy to append or work with code if future changes come up that require maintenance or updates in the code structure.  It is important to optimize for whoever may be working with or reading the code. I try not to be redundant or include anything unnecessary by keeping things as simple as possible. Adaptable code is necessary to ensure there is no starting over when things change. I try to approach problems by breaking them down into multiple, simple tasks. I focus on what tools and knowledge that I need to complete said tasks. A strong emphasis on requirements helps me to modulate the tasks that I need to complete, as well as helps me to estimate the time required to complete them. Computer Scientists build tools, create solutions to everyday problems, and design applications on computers. For example, this project with Grazioso Salvare, allowed the company to be more efficient in collecting, storing, updating, and viewing important data that is required to run their business.
